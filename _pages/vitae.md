## Research
- 4D printing
 When smart materials encounter 3D printing, the printed objects can change their shape or other properities upon external stimuli. Our work is to improve the precision of this kind of actuations using closed loop method with traditional and modern control techniques.
Soft robots
Soft robots are a subset of robots constructed from highly compliant materials. We build innovative soft robots with enhanced controllability and functionality.
Reinforcement learning
We deploy reinforcement learning systems to train agents that can precisely control the soft actuations that are hard to be modeled.
