The project is funded by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr√•det) with the title '[Closed-Loop 4D Printing with High Precision](https://www.iip.kth.se/sps/current-projects/4d-printing-1.917040){:target="https://www.iip.kth.se/sps/current-projects/4d-printing-1.917040"}'.

Conventional 4D printed actuation is normally performed in open loop, which can lead to uncontrolled and low precise movements. The core methodology of this project is to apply different closed loop control methods to increase the precision of 4D printing actuation.

In the project, we take 4D printed Shape Memory Polymer (SMP), which is a very commonly used thermal stimulated material for 4D printing, to perform the closed loop control studies.
