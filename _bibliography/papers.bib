  abstract   = {{3D-printing (3DP) technology has been developing rapidly. However, limited studies on the contribution of 3DP technology, especially multimaterial 3DP technology, to droplet-microfluidics have been reported. In this paper, multimaterial 3D-printed devices for the pneumatic control of emulsion generation have been reported. A 3D coaxial flexible channel with other rigid structures has been designed and printed monolithically. Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated that this flexible channel can be excited by the air pressure and then deform in a controllable way, which can provide the active control of droplet generation. Furthermore, a novel modular microfluidic device for double emulsion generation has been designed and fabricated, which consists of three modules: function module, T-junction module, and co-flow module. The function module can be replaced by (1) Single-inlet module, (2) Pneumatic Control Unit (PCU) module and (3) Dual-inlet module. Different modules can be easily assembled for different double emulsion production. By using the PCU module, double emulsions with different number of inner droplets have been successfully produced without complicated operation of flow rates of different phases. By using single and dual inlet module, various double emulsions with different number of encapsulated droplets or encapsulated droplets with different compositions have been successfully produced, respectively.}}

  abstract   = {{The development of integrated microfluidic systems/platforms concerns many fields. Current remarkable integrated systems based on stacking multi-layer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) require complicated fabrication and operation and still remain challenging. We propose a novel micro-millifluidic processing system (MPS) comprising three core modules: a motherboard, a control panel and microfluidic chips. Fluids are handled in sub-millichannels in a motherboard and functional operations occur in microchannels in microfluidic chips. A motherboard with versatile functional units for fluid handling was monolithically fabricated via multimaterial 3D printing, which avoids multi-layer structures, and the major disadvantage of current 3D printing, i.e. low resolution, has been overcome by integrating novel microfluidic chips based on our developed maskless lithography platform. Both numerical and experimental studies were conducted to validate our system. Potential applications such as droplet generation and distribution, microfluidic mixing and simple bacterial resistance tests have been demonstrated via our MPS.}}

  abstract  = {{Droplet microfluidics has become the most promising subcategory of microfluidics since it contributes numerous applications to diverse fields. However, fabrication of microfluidic devices for droplet formation, manipulation and applications is usually complicated and expensive. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) provides an exciting alternative to conventional techniques by simplifying the process and reducing the cost of fabrication. Complex and novel structures can be achieved via 3DP in a simple and rapid manner, enabling droplet microfluidics accessible to more extensive users. In this article, we review and discuss current development, opportunities and challenges of applications of 3DP to droplet microfluidics.}}

  abstract     = {{Soft robots, made of soft materials such as dielectric elastomer or shape memory polymers, have received tremendous attentions due to its dexterousness, flexibility and safety compared with rigid robots. However, wider application of soft robots is limited due to their complex fabrication process and poor controllability. Here, we introduce a closed loop controlled soft actuator that is fully 3D printed with flexible material. The structure of the soft actuator is optimized with Finite Element Method (FEM) to acquire shortest fabrication time and highest deformation for same stimulus input. A desktop Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printer is used for low-cost fabrication of such actuators. A webcamera is used for the image feedback which offers the real time shape monitoring of the soft actuator. An output feedback Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller with lowpass filter is developed with pole placement design method based on a data-driven model of the 3D printed soft actuator. The controller is implemented to regulate the input air pressure to ensure a fast-response, precise and robust shape changing for any work environments.}}

  abstract  = {{Four-dimensional printing (4DP) is a newly emerged technology that uses smart materials for additive manufacturing and thus enables shape and/or property change upon stimulus after the printing process. Present study on 4DP has been focused on open loop stimulus, which can hardly ensure high shape precision and predictable final states. In this paper, a new closed loop 4DP (CL4DP) process supplementing 4D printed actuation with closed loop control methods is proposed. Image feedback is used for enhancing the conventional open loop 4DP morphing process and a controller is implemented to regulate the intensity of the stimulus accordingly in real-time. To achieve precise control, a nonlinear affine system model is built by model identification with measurement data to describe the dynamic shape recovery process of the 4D printed Shape Memory Polymer (SMP). Precise shape control is achieved and the effects of controller parameters on the precision of CL4DP are studied. Traditionally, SMP has a discrete number of selected steady states. With CL4DP, such steady states can be continuous and arbitrary.}}

One key concern of 4DP is how to effectivelyand quickly meet different production and application requirements considering thecomplexity of materials and diversity of stimulus methods. In order to provide ageneral research platform for 4DP researchers, a flexible 4DP service platform isproposed. Components and modules for building 4DP and test systems are modeledand virtualized to form the different resources. These resources are then integratedvirtually or physically to provide some basic functions such as a 3D displacementstage or a visual monitoring system. According to different 4DP requirements, thesefunctions are then encapsulated into services to serve different research. Theplatform enables a variety of 4DP applications in smart manufacturing environmentssuch as 4D printed magnetic medical robots, test platform for studying the 4DPresponse, etc. A case study on designing a ferromagnetic 4DP platform based on theservice platform is performed to prove the feasibility of the method.}}

  abstract  = {{The thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material is an elastomer that canbe used for inflatable products. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a widelyused additive manufacturing process for TPU material due to the capability ofgenerating complex structures with low cost. However, TPU is soft and thusdifficult to be extruded as continuously and uniformly as hard materials such aspolylactide by FDM. Inappropriate extruder structure and speed settings can leadto filament buckling problem, resulting in poor material filling quality, longprinting time and low printing success rate. This paper aims at improving the FDMprinting efficiency of TPU inflatable products by adding lateral support to thefilament and finding out the appropriate speed ranges for different wall featuresand thicknesses. Firstly, a filament guide sheet is designed as being inserted intothe gap between the drive gears and the bottom frame of the gear chamber in orderto prevent the soft TPU filament from buckling. Secondly, inflatable product wallfeatures are classified into floors, roofs and sidewalls and experiment for findingthe relationship between printing speed and airtightness is carried out. In order toverify the proposed solution, wall features are printed and the material fillingsobtained under different printing speeds are compared by measuring theairtightness of the wall features. Results show that the proposed filament guidesheet mitigates filament buckling, and the speed range that meets the airtightnessrequirement can be found for various wall features and thicknesses. In summary,the sealing of the filament feeding channel between the drive gears and the nozzle,as well as the speed optimisation according to product features, are essential forthe efficient printing of TPU inflatable products.}}
