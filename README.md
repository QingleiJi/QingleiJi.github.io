This is my personal website: [qinglei.tech](https://qinglei.tech/)

## Getting started

The website is derived from [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
If you like the theme, give it a star!

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
