**First update** *(2020-05-06)*

I have actually never used google cloud services in the past, until today I notice three unknown charges from them. It's a pity that I join this group due to this reason... But I would like to share and record this experience here so that everyone can be more cautious about your network/account safety.

Here's what happened until now:

- The three bills are made in two days, with a total amount of 3,000 usd.
- I have blocked my bank account and will contact them by phone tomorrow.
- I entered the google cloud platform and can find the three bills. There are even several projects created using the service. But I have no sense of them at all. It feels really annoying and offended that these things just comes into your account without your conscious.
- I contacted the google cloud service by phone but it seems that the operator doesn't have the authority to help me on that. He recommend me:
  - Report unauthorized charges ([Link](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2851610?hl=en))
    - I did so, it takes up to 12 days for processing. What I can do is just wait.
  - Secure a hacked or compromised account ([Link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6294825?hl=en))
    - I did accordingly but didn't find any strange logins or unsecure events.

Got no idea how this will end but I do hope I'm the last one to face this issue.

**Second update** *(2020-05-07)*

There are some important updates today and some has shocked me.

- I have reported the case to police. However, according to experience, they won't really try to solve such 'small problem' rather than just record it.
- I will send a claim to the bank by mail and they will process it after receiving the files.
- Right now I'm pretty sure that my gmail account is compromised.
  - I have also find out why I haven't received any warning or reminds. **The bad guy set a lot of filters in my gmail. All the messages from google and google cloud has been set as read and deleted automatically!** I then checked the trash and find back the billings and many other emails from google.
  - The bad guy created a lot of missions on google cloud. I'm not sure what they do exactly but one of them is named as 'external seeker', which I guess is for looking for other victims. These services are stopped by google after some days due to violation to user terms. However new missions are then created again. During this process, all the reminder e-mails has been filtered so the bad guy can keep repeating his work while I have no sense.
  - I have now changed my google account password, added the 2-steps verification, reset the router, blocked the bank card. Hopefully there won't be more loss. I really appreciate the friends who has given me suggestions.

So the case is quite clear now. Do you think I can get the money back?

Again, keep yourself safe!

**Third update** *(2020-05-08)*

There are some more updates from myside and google has send me a series of emails which are super confusing and annoying.

- I have send to the bank the claim letter and some required files. It takes time for the mail to arrive and for them to process. I notice some others who had the same 'google cloud billing' issues with me. It seems that they have get their loss back either from the bank side or from google, which relieves me a little.
- I got some messages from google.
  - First email is informing me that my google account is disabled because of a purchase that violates google's terms of service and I need to restore it. I need to report to google if I don't recognize a purchase. Then I recovered my account but I have already reported the unauthorized purchases before. I don't quite understand what this messages means.
  - Another email about fraud protection alert after I recovered the account. It's some reminds about how to protect my account such as enable 2-step verification. I have already done this.
  - Then I got an email about my Youtube premium is canceled and I will get the refunds. This really confuses me as the charge issue is about google cloud. Maybe it's some kind of protection actions. However, I have already blocked my back account. Got no idea how I will be refunded.
  - Then I got a new email regarding google cloud. It says that one of my billing account is under review and I need to verify the paying information to resolve the issue. I did the verification accordingly. I have no idea why I got this email either. The bad guy created four billing accounts with my bank account and every of them has charges on my bank account. I have reported this to google. Don't know why just one billing account is reviewed by google.
  - I got another email, telling me that the previous mentioned account is recovered and the associated projects are recovered. I'm really confused by google. What I desire is stopping these projects. Google reactivated them.
  - I have replied the email and repeated my appeals. No reply until now.

That's the updates until now. Got no word to say about google.

**Forth update** *(2020-05-11)*

There are some good news from google and the bank.

- On 2020-05-08 night after the update, google service send me a email about that they have forwarded my case to a special team for processing. For Safety, they have suspended the four billing accounts and all the projects. They will contact me later if they got updates.
- After the last email, I received a series of emails about the suspension of the billing accounts and the projects. This make me feel safe. At least this projects won't be running any more.
- A big good news is that my bank send me a message telling me that they have temporarily compensated me with the money I lose. However, they keep the right to withdraw the money if the returns are made by the sales company. Here, as I understand, the sales company refers to google. I am quite impressed by the high efficiency of the bank. I think they have received my complaint and processed it immediately. They also said that the case is now closed. I don't know if they will follow up with google and make some investigations or they just take the loss and refund me.

So, that's it for now. Anyway I have get the money back from bank although there's no feedback from google yet. I will keep waiting until a reply from google is made.

**Fifth update** *(2020-05-18)*

After one week's waiting, google finally replies, but with a negative investigation result... They said that 'We were unable to confirm fraudulent activity on the purchases. Often, these purchases were made by a family member or friend.' That is to say, they won't return the charge. They even send me a separate e-mail requiring me to confirm my payment information so that they can keep charging me and recover the projects. NO WAY google!

Well, I am quite disappointed by this conclusion. I don't know how google has investigated in my claim. In case they have done it a little bit more carefully, they should find out they are wrong. However, keep claiming to google seems not helpful anymore as they leave no further door for reclaiming this case. I guess it just end like this, with my bank undertaken the loss while google just keep this systematic bug until more victims are involved.

**Sixth update** *(2020-05-22)*

The police send me a report of my case, telling me that the preliminary investigated is now ended and the case is closed as there are no clue pointing at a certain person who did the crime.

Well, alright.
